Compatibility
=============

## Overview

To survive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>, any improvement in computing systems must be compatible with currently popular commodity hardware, operating systems, file formats, and network protocols.  In other words, it must be portable and interoperable.  Macroni satisfies these requirements by being able to run as a process and only changing internals.

To protect software from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in</a>, it must not depend upon uncommon hardware or operating system properties.  In other words, it must be portable.  Macroni satisfies these requirements by providing APIs designed to abstract over hardware and operating system differences and only expose the lowest common denominator of hardware and operating system features.
