User Interface
==============

## Overview

Macroni appears to use a conventional GUI, but it is [vector-graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)-based and system dialogs, cut and paste, and drag and drop grant single-use capabilities.  The only authorization prompts are for [installation endowments](Capability_Security_Model.md#using-capabilities), and those only occur when the owner-user installs programs.

Macroni provides a rich set of [chiseled widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) so that its applications can have consistent appearance and behavior and it is obvious what can be interacted with and how.
